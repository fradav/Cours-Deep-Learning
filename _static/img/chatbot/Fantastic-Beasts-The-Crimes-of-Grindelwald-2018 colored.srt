keep him here in custody.</font>

He's extremely powerful.</font>

I know the form.</font>

00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,227
<font color="#ffff80">- And maybe a little less.
- Like me?</font>

Come on. Let's go.</font>

traveling internationally. Why?</font>

58
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:45,376
<font color="#ffff80">Because I like to
travel internationally.</font>

61
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:55,357
<font color="#ffff80">So I was collecting material for
my book on magical beasts</font>

63
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,477
<font color="#ffff80">No, that's actually factually
incorrect on two counts</font>

66
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:08,556
<font color="#ffff80">it's clear you're frustrated
and, frankly, so are we.</font>

67
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:14,186

we'd like to make a proposition.</font>

68
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:15,483
<font color="#ffff80">What kind of proposition?</font>

69

<font color="#ffff80">The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,491

destroyed.</font>

79
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:51,263
<font color="#ffff80">And for certain members of our

non-magic world as well.</font>

82
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,435

83
00:12:04,436 --> 00:12:07,916
<font color="#ffff80">and Grindelwald sees this boy</font>

84
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,956
<font color="#ffff80">as a means
to make this all come true.</font>

85
00:12:12,824 --> 00:12:16,262
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry. You're talking about
Credence as if he were still here.</font>

86
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,406
<font color="#ffff80">He survived, Newt.</font>

exactly, we don't know, but...</font>

90
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,472
<font color="#ffff80">And you want me to hunt Credence down?</font>

<font color="#ffff80">I think you're gonna have to
pull your head out of the sand!</font>

137
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:13,543
<font color="#ffff80">Even though you did.</font>

138
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:17,246
<font color="#ffff80">You told me where to find
that trafficked Thunderbird,</font>

139
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,211
<font color="#ffff80">Dumbledore. You knew that I
would take him home and you</font>

140
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:20,767
<font color="#ffff80">knew I'd have to take him through
a Muggle port.</font>

141
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:23,502
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I've always felt an affinity with
the great magical birds..</font>

142
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,902
<font color="#ffff80">There's a story in my family</font>

143
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:29,957
<font color="#ffff80">that a phoenix will come to any
Dumbledore who is in desperate need.</font>

144
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,930
<font color="#ffff80">They say my great-great grandfather had
one, but that it took flight when he died,</font>

145
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:36,589
<font color="#ffff80">never to return.</font>

146
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,887
<font color="#ffff80">With all due respect, I
don't believe for a minute</font>

147
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:42,520
<font color="#ffff80">that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.</font>

148
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,814
<font color="#ffff80">Credence is in Paris, Newt.</font>

149
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,060
<font color="#ffff80">He's trying to trace his real family.</font>

150
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,481
<font color="#ffff80">I take it.</font>

151
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:56,838
<font color="#ffff80">You've heard the rumors</font>

152
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:57,984
<font color="#ffff80">about who he really is?</font>

153
00:18:58,644 --> 00:18:59,859
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

154
00:19:07,043 --> 00:19:11,502
<font color="#ffff80">The pure-bloods think he's
the last of an important French line,</font>

155
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,101
<font color="#ffff80">a baby whom
everyone thought lost</font>

156
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:19,486
<font color="#ffff80">- Not Leta's brother?
- That's what they're whispering.</font>

157
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:23,064
<font color="#ffff80">Pure-blood or not, I know this...</font>

158
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:26,131
<font color="#ffff80">An Obscurus grows in the absence of love</font>

159
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,528
<font color="#ffff80">as a dark twin, an only friend.</font>

160
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,024
<font color="#ffff80">If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,</font>

161
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,619
<font color="#ffff80">he might yet be saved.</font>

162
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,412
<font color="#ffff80">Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's
either in danger or a danger to others.</font>

163
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,479
<font color="#ffff80">We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.</font>

164
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:48,151
<font color="#ffff80">And I rather hoped you might
be the one to find him.</font>

165
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,754
<font color="#ffff80">What's that?</font>

166
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:59,256
<font color="#ffff80">An address of a very
old acquaintance of mine.</font>

167
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:03,634
<font color="#ffff80">A safe house in Paris,
reinforced with enchantments.</font>

168
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,040
<font color="#ffff80">Safe house? Why would I
need a safe house in Paris?</font>

169
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,705
<font color="#ffff80">One hopes you won't, but
should things at some point</font>

170
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:11,217
<font color="#ffff80">go terribly wrong,
it's good to have a place to go.</font>

171
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,644
<font color="#ffff80">You know, for a cup of tea.</font>

172
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:16,558
<font color="#ffff80">No, no, no, absolutely not.</font>

173
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,658
<font color="#ffff80">I'm banned from international
travel, Dumbledore.</font>

174
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,754
<font color="#ffff80">If I leave the country, they will put
me in Azkaban and throw away the key.</font>

175
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,577
<font color="#ffff80">Do you know why I admire you, Newt?</font>

176
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:25,598
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

177
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:28,157
<font color="#ffff80">More, perhaps, than any
man I know?</font>

178
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:34,250
<font color="#ffff80">You don't seek power or popularity.</font>

179
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:39,909
<font color="#ffff80">You simply ask, is the thing
right in itself?</font>

180
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,862
<font color="#ffff80">If it is, you do
it, no matter the cost.</font>

181
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,803
<font color="#ffff80">That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but, forgive me for asking,</font>

182
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,779
<font color="#ffff80">why can't you go?</font>

183
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:56,618
<font color="#ffff80">I cannot move against Grindelwald.</font>

184
00:20:59,588 --> 00:21:00,916
<font color="#ffff80">It has to be you.</font>

185
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,283
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I can't blame you,</font>

186
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:12,132
<font color="#ffff80">in your shoes I'd probably refuse too.</font>

187
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,415
<font color="#ffff80">- What...?
- It's late.</font>

188
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,479
<font color="#ffff80">- Good evening, Newt.
- Wait. No!</font>

189
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,617
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, come on.</font>

190
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:33,969
<font color="#ffff80">Dumbledore.</font>

191
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,671
<font color="#ffff80">Bunty!</font>

192
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,090
<font color="#ffff80">Bunty!</font>

193
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,763
<font color="#ffff80">Bunty, the baby Nifflers are loose again!</font>

194
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:03,417
<font color="#ffff80">Well done</font>

195
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:04,768
<font color="#ffff80">I'm so sorry, Newt.</font>

196
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,769
<font color="#ffff80">They must have picked the lock while I was
cleaning out the Augureys</font>

197
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,808
<font color="#ffff80">Not to worry.</font>

198
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:17,613
<font color="#ffff80">I've fed nearly everyone,
Pinky's had his nose drops, and</font>

199
00:23:17,614 --> 00:23:18,448
<font color="#ffff80">And Elsie?</font>

200
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,874
<font color="#ffff80">- Elsie's droppings are nearly normal again.
- Wonderful.</font>

201
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,007
<font color="#ffff80">You can clock off now...</font>

202
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:30,667
<font color="#ffff80">- I told you to leave the Kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.</font>

203
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:32,731
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want you losing fingers over it.</font>

204
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:45,014
<font color="#ffff80">Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.</font>

205
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:47,455
<font color="#ffff80">You must be exhausted.</font>

206
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,883
<font color="#ffff80">You know the Kelpie's easier with two.</font>

207
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,418
<font color="#ffff80">Perhaps you should take off your shirt?</font>

208
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,132
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly enough.</font>

209
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,901
<font color="#ffff80">Someone needed to let off some steam.</font>

210
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,514
<font color="#ffff80">Ointment, Bunty?</font>

211
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,216
<font color="#ffff80">You bite Bunty again and
there'll be trouble, mister.</font>

212
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:02,216
<font color="#ffff80">- What was that?
- I don't know.</font>

213
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:06,993
<font color="#ffff80">But I want you to go home now, Bunty.</font>

214
00:25:06,994 --> 00:25:10,807
<font color="#ffff80">- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No, I want you to go home. Please.</font>

215
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,527
<font color="#ffff80">If you could just give it to me...</font>

216
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,059
<font color="#ffff80">Honey, if you could just give it to me.</font>

217
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,182
<font color="#ffff80">- He doesn't care. Hold it.
- If you could just give it to me.</font>

218
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,227
<font color="#ffff80">Hey...</font>

219
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:37,868
<font color="#ffff80">NEWT! Get over here, you maniac.</font>

220
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,305
<font color="#ffff80">We hope you don't mind, Newt?
We let ourselves in...</font>

221
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,902
<font color="#ffff80">it's raining
out there-cats and dogs!</font>

222
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:45,391
<font color="#ffff80">London's cold!</font>

223
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:48,196
<font color="#ffff80">But you were supposed
to have been Obliviated!</font>

224
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,631
<font color="#ffff80">I know!
It didn't work, pal.</font>

225
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:54,032
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, you said it, the potion
only erases bad memories.</font>

226
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,276
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't have any.</font>

227
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:59,670
<font color="#ffff80">I mean, don't get me wrong, I had
some weird ones...</font>

228
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,979
<font color="#ffff80">but this angel...</font>

229
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:05,035
<font color="#ffff80">this angel over here, she filled
me in on all the bad parts.</font>

230
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,668
<font color="#ffff80">And here we are, I guess, huh?</font>

231
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:10,423
<font color="#ffff80">This is wonderful!</font>

232
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:16,171
<font color="#ffff80">Is ...Tina?</font>

233
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:18,751
<font color="#ffff80">Tina?</font>

234
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,803
<font color="#ffff80">Oh it's just us, honey.</font>

235
00:26:23,744 --> 00:26:25,026
<font color="#ffff80">Me and Jacob.</font>

236
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,788
<font color="#ffff80">Why don't I make us some dinner, huh?</font>

237
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:29,814
<font color="#ffff80">Yes!</font>

238
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:38,325
<font color="#ffff80">Tina and I aren't talking.</font>

239
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:39,667
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

240
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,322
<font color="#ffff80">Oh well, you know, she
found out about Jacob and</font>

241
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,814
<font color="#ffff80">I seeing each other and
she didn't like it,</font>

242
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,352
<font color="#ffff80">cause of the “law.”</font>

243
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:50,538
<font color="#ffff80">Not allowed oops, not
allowed to date No-Majs,</font>

244
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,851
<font color="#ffff80">not allowed to marry them blah, blah, blah.</font>

245
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:57,606
<font color="#ffff80">Well, she was all in a tizzy
anyway, 'cause of you.</font>

246
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:58,791
<font color="#ffff80">Me?</font>

247
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,593
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, you, Newt.</font>

248
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,661
<font color="#ffff80">It was in Spellbound.</font>

249
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,606
<font color="#ffff80">Here-I brought it for you-</font>

250
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:12,473
<font color="#ffff80">Newt Scamander with
fiancée, Leta Lestrange...</font>

251
00:27:12,474 --> 00:27:14,632
<font color="#ffff80">brother, Theseus
and unknown woman.</font>

252
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:18,472
<font color="#ffff80">No. Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.</font>

253
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,651
<font color="#ffff80">Oh!</font>

254
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:23,451
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, oh dear.</font>

255
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:25,667
<font color="#ffff80">Wah.</font>

256
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:31,554
<font color="#ffff80">So Tina read that, and she started dating
someone else.</font>

257
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:35,114
<font color="#ffff80">He's an Auror. His name's
Achilles Tolliver.</font>

258
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,399
<font color="#ffff80">Tolliver?</font>

259
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:46,141
<font color="#ffff80">Anyway... We're real
excited to be here, Newt.</font>

260
00:27:46,302 --> 00:27:49,661
<font color="#ffff80">This is a, oh
it's a special trip for us</font>

261
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:52,514
<font color="#ffff80">You see, Jacob and I,</font>

262
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,894
<font color="#ffff80">we're getting married.</font>

263
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,813
<font color="#ffff80">I'm marrying Jacob!</font>

264
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,255
<font color="#ffff80">You've enchanted him, haven't you?</font>

265
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:11,401
<font color="#ffff80">What?</font>

266
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:14,122
<font color="#ffff80">I have not.</font>

267
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:16,632
<font color="#ffff80">Will you stop reading my mind?</font>

268
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,429
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie, you've brought him
here against his will.</font>

269
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:21,537
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, that is an
outrageous accusation.</font>

270
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:25,570
<font color="#ffff80">Look at him. He's just happy.</font>

271
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,443
<font color="#ffff80">Then you won't mind if I...</font>

272
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:30,369
<font color="#ffff80">Please don't!</font>

273
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,109
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie, you've got nothing to
fear if he wants to get married.</font>

274
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,059
<font color="#ffff80">We can just lift the enchantment...
and he can tell us himself.</font>

275
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,506
<font color="#ffff80">What you got there?</font>

276
00:28:47,822 --> 00:28:51,510
<font color="#ffff80">Whatchu gonna do? Whatchu gonna do with
that, Mr. Scamander?</font>

277
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:52,772
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Surgito.</i></font>

278
00:29:03,788 --> 00:29:06,324
<font color="#ffff80">Congratulations on
your engagement, Jacob.</font>

279
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,349
<font color="#ffff80">Wait, what?</font>

280
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,351
<font color="#ffff80">Oh no, you didn't.</font>

281
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,958
<font color="#ffff80">Queen. A second.</font>

282
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:20,229
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie!</font>

283
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:22,929
<font color="#ffff80">It's very nice to see you.</font>

284
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,625
<font color="#ffff80">Where the hell am I right now?</font>

285
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:25,626
<font color="#ffff80">Uh, uh, London.</font>

286
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,514
<font color="#ffff80">Oh! I always wanted to go here!</font>

287
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:30,935
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie!</font>

288
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,867
<font color="#ffff80">Oh Queenie, honey.</font>

289
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:40,230
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I'm just curious, when were you going
to wake me up? After we'd had five kids?</font>

290
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,956
<font color="#ffff80">- Why is it wrong to want to marry you?
- Okay.</font>

291
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:48,609
<font color="#ffff80">To wanna have a family?</font>

292
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,444
<font color="#ffff80">I just want what everyone
else has, that's all.</font>

293
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:54,591
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, wait..</font>

294
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,351
<font color="#ffff80">We talked about this,
like, a million times.</font>

295
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:59,068
<font color="#ffff80">If we get married and
they find out, they're</font>

296
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,478
<font color="#ffff80">gonna throw you in
jail, sweetheart.</font>

297
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,509
<font color="#ffff80">I can't have that.</font>

298
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,918
<font color="#ffff80">They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.</font>

299
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,918
<font color="#ffff80">I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.</font>

300
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:13,453
<font color="#ffff80">They're really progressive here, and
they'll let us get married properly.</font>

301
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,008
<font color="#ffff80">Sweetheart, you don't need to enchant me.</font>

302
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,129
<font color="#ffff80">I'm already enchanted!</font>

303
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:21,268
<font color="#ffff80">I love you so much.</font>

304
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:22,977
<font color="#ffff80">- Yeah??
- Yeah.</font>

305
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:26,481
<font color="#ffff80">But I can't have you risking
everything like this, you know?</font>

306
00:30:26,482 --> 00:30:29,357
<font color="#ffff80">You're not giving us a choice, sweetheart.</font>

307
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:34,212
<font color="#ffff80">You're not givin' me a choice.</font>

308
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:37,969
<font color="#ffff80">One of us had to be brave, and you
were being a coward!</font>

309
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,856
<font color="#ffff80">I was being a coward?</font>

310
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,115
<font color="#ffff80">If I'm a coward, you're...</font>

311
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,703
<font color="#ffff80">Crazy!</font>

312
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:49,694
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't say it...</font>

313
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:50,838
<font color="#ffff80">You didn't have to.</font>

314
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,653
<font color="#ffff80">No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.</font>

315
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:54,802
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, you did.</font>

316
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:56,856
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

317
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,325
<font color="#ffff80">I'm gonna go see my sister.</font>

318
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:00,897
<font color="#ffff80">Fine. See your sister.</font>

319
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:02,244
<font color="#ffff80">- Fine.
- No! Wait!</font>

320
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,037
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie! No! Queenie!</font>

321
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:08,505
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't mean it.</font>

322
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,831
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't say nothing.</font>

323
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:34,557
<font color="#ffff80">PARIS</font>

324
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:41,142
<font color="#ffff80">My dear Queenie,
what a beautiful city.</font>

325
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,702
<font color="#ffff80">I'm thinking of you, Tina.</font>

326
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,416
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, Newt?</font>

327
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,617
<font color="#ffff80">Down here, Jacob.
I'll be with you in a second.</font>

328
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,672
<font color="#ffff80">I got my own problems.</font>

329
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,761
<font color="#ffff80">BUNTY! DON'T FORGET TO
GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.</font>

330
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:27,387
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie left a postcard.</font>

331
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,659
<font color="#ffff80">Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.</font>

332
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,948
<font color="#ffff80">Genius!</font>

333
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,621
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.</font>

334
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,694
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, we're going to France, pal!</font>

335
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,032
<font color="#ffff80">Hold on. I'll get my jacket.</font>

336
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,033
<font color="#ffff80">I've got it.</font>

337
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:46,585
<font color="#ffff80">Oh. Beautiful.</font>

338
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,769
<font color="#ffff80">BUNTY, GONE TO PARIS. HAVE
TAKEN NIFFLERS WITH ME. NEWT.</font>

339
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,966
<font color="#ffff80">Nagini.</font>

340
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:13,855
<font color="#ffff80">Credence.</font>

341
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,605
<font color="#ffff80">I think I know where she is.</font>

342
00:34:25,312 --> 00:34:26,764
<font color="#ffff80">We escape tonight.</font>

343
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:27,765
<font color="#ffff80">Hey.</font>

344
00:34:33,433 --> 00:34:36,490
<font color="#ffff80">I've told you to stay away from her, boy.</font>

345
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:38,907
<font color="#ffff80">Did I say you could
take a break?</font>

346
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:40,982
<font color="#ffff80">Clean out the Kappa.</font>

347
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,570
<font color="#ffff80">And you, get ready!</font>

348
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:01,873
<font color="#ffff80">Next in our little show of
freaks and oddities...</font>

349
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:04,508
<font color="#ffff80">I present to you...</font>

350
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:06,234
<font color="#ffff80">a Maledictus!</font>

351
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:12,961
<font color="#ffff80">Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia,</font>

352
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:16,481
<font color="#ffff80">she is the carrier of a
blood curse.</font>

353
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,875
<font color="#ffff80">Such Under-beings are destined,
through the course of their lives...</font>

354
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,922
<font color="#ffff80">to turn permanently into beasts.</font>

355
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,206
<font color="#ffff80">But look at her. So beautiful, yes?</font>

356
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:36,864
<font color="#ffff80">So desirable.</font>

357
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:42,018
<font color="#ffff80">But soon she will be trapped
forever in a very different body.</font>

358
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,621
<font color="#ffff80">Every night, when she sleeps...</font>

359
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:47,948
<font color="#ffff80">mesdames et messieurs...</font>

360
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,070
<font color="#ffff80">She is forced to become...</font>

361
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:01,086
<font color="#ffff80">She is forced to become...</font>

362
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:09,050
<font color="#ffff80">She is forced to become...</font>

363
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:22,408
<font color="#ffff80">Over time, she will not be
able to transform back.</font>

364
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,590
<font color="#ffff80">She will be
forever trapped in the body of a snake.</font>

365
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:02,847
<font color="#ffff80">Credence!</font>

366
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,408
<font color="#ffff80">Pack it up!</font>

367
00:37:13,804 --> 00:37:15,776
<font color="#ffff80">Paris is done for us now.</font>

368
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,440
<font color="#ffff80">The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?</font>

369
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:53,714
<font color="#ffff80">He's looking for his mother.</font>

370
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,800
<font color="#ffff80">All my freaks think they can go home.</font>

371
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,548
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, let's go.</font>

372
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:21,041
<font color="#ffff80">Look, I think we were both at the circus
for the same reason, monsieur ...?</font>

373
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:23,752
<font color="#ffff80">Kama. Yusuf Kama.</font>

374
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,149
<font color="#ffff80">And you think right.</font>

375
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,808
<font color="#ffff80">- What do you want with Credence?
- The same as you.</font>

376
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,334
<font color="#ffff80">- Which is?
- To prove who the boy really is.</font>

377
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:38,553
<font color="#ffff80">If the rumors of his identity are
correct, he and</font>

378
00:38:38,636 --> 00:38:40,841
<font color="#ffff80">I are distantly related.</font>

379
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,519
<font color="#ffff80">I am the last male of my
pure-blooded line.</font>

380
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,390
<font color="#ffff80">And so, if the rumors are correct, is he.</font>

381
00:38:48,689 --> 00:38:52,853
<font color="#ffff80">Have you read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus?</font>

382
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,893
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.
But that's poetry, not proof.</font>

383
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,562
<font color="#ffff80">If I could show you something better</font>

384
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:07,711
<font color="#ffff80">more concrete, something
that proves who he is</font>

385
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:11,549
<font color="#ffff80">would the Ministries of Europe and America
let him live?</font>

386
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:13,483
<font color="#ffff80">They might.</font>

387
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,212
<font color="#ffff80">Then come.</font>

388
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:43,167
<font color="#ffff80">So...</font>

389
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,577
<font color="#ffff80">Credence Barebone.</font>

390
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,714
<font color="#ffff80">Nearly destroyed by the woman who
raised him.</font>

391
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:58,120
<font color="#ffff80">Yet now he seeks the mother who bore him.</font>

392
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:00,853
<font color="#ffff80">He's desperate for family.</font>

393
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,015
<font color="#ffff80">He's desperate for love.</font>

394
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,154
<font color="#ffff80">He's the key to our victory.</font>

395
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:10,134
<font color="#ffff80">Well, we know where the boy is, don't we?</font>

396
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:14,791
<font color="#ffff80">- Why don't we grab him and leave!
- He must come to me freely...</font>

397
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,401
<font color="#ffff80">and he will.</font>

398
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,114
<font color="#ffff80">The path has been laid,
and he is following it.</font>

399
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:26,039
<font color="#ffff80">The trail that will lead him to me,</font>

400
00:40:26,978 --> 00:40:30,737
<font color="#ffff80">and the strange and glorious
truth of who he is.</font>

401
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,602
<font color="#ffff80">Why is he so important?</font>

402
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,395
<font color="#ffff80">Who represents the greatest
threat to our cause?</font>

403
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,727
<font color="#ffff80">Albus Dumbledore.</font>

404
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:50,870
<font color="#ffff80">If I asked you now to go to the school...
where he is</font>

405
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:55,369
<font color="#ffff80">hiding and kill him for me,
would you do it for me, Krall?</font>

406
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:04,886
<font color="#ffff80">Credence is the only entity alive...</font>

407
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,302
<font color="#ffff80">who can kill him.</font>

408
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,217
<font color="#ffff80">You really think that he
can kill the great...</font>

409
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,092
<font color="#ffff80">can kill Albus Dumbledore?</font>

410
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:17,944
<font color="#ffff80">I know he can.</font>

411
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:23,221
<font color="#ffff80">But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?</font>

412
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:27,905
<font color="#ffff80">Will you?</font>

413
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:42,420
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob, that man Tina's been seeing...</font>

414
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,019
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry, she's gonna see you.</font>

415
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,828
<font color="#ffff80">And she'll see the four of
us together, it'll be just</font>

416
00:41:45,852 --> 00:41:47,567
<font color="#ffff80">like New York all over again.
Don't worry about it.</font>

417
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,688
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie said?
- Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?</font>

418
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:51,763
<font color="#ffff80">Don't worry about him.</font>

419
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,991
<font color="#ffff80">What do you think I should
say to her, if I see her?</font>

420
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,310
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, well, it's best not
to plan these things.</font>

421
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,210
<font color="#ffff80">You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.</font>

422
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:13,477
<font color="#ffff80">She has eyes just like a salamander.</font>

423
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,111
<font color="#ffff80">Don't say that.</font>

424
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:22,227
<font color="#ffff80">Nah, look, you just tell
her that you missed her.</font>

425
00:42:22,228 --> 00:42:26,715
<font color="#ffff80">Right, and then you
came all the way to Paris just to find her.</font>

426
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:28,771
<font color="#ffff80">She'll love that.</font>

427
00:42:28,772 --> 00:42:33,609
<font color="#ffff80">And then, tell her you're losing
sleep at night for thinking of her.</font>

428
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,097
<font color="#ffff80">Just don't say
anything about no salamanders, all right?</font>

429
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:38,363
<font color="#ffff80">Right. Okay.</font>

430
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:43,478
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be all right.</font>

431
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:45,080
<font color="#ffff80">We're in this together, pal.</font>

432
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,364
<font color="#ffff80">Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna
help you find Tina, find Queenie,</font>

433
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:52,561
<font color="#ffff80">and we'll all be happy again.
Just like old times.</font>

434
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:53,586
<font color="#ffff80">Who is this guy?</font>

435
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,354
<font color="#ffff80">He's the only way I can leave the
country without documentation.</font>

436
00:42:58,355 --> 00:43:01,116
<font color="#ffff80">Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?</font>

437
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,728
<font color="#ffff80">I don't do well on boats, Newt.</font>

438
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:04,864
<font color="#ffff80">You'll be fine.</font>

439
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,462
<font color="#ffff80">Stir your stumps-it leaves in one minute!</font>

440
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:09,877
<font color="#ffff80">Fifty Galleons.</font>

441
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:11,637
<font color="#ffff80">No, we said thirty.</font>

442
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:13,519
<font color="#ffff80">Thirty to go to France,</font>

443
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,659
<font color="#ffff80">twenty not to tell anyone, I seen Newt
Scamander leaving the country illegally.</font>

444
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:21,939
<font color="#ffff80">Price of fame, pal.</font>

445
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:27,484
<font color="#ffff80">Ten seconds.</font>

446
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:30,194
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob.</font>

447
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:31,361
<font color="#ffff80">Seven.</font>

448
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:33,686
<font color="#ffff80">Six</font>

449
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:37,586
<font color="#ffff80">Four.</font>

450
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
<font color="#ffff80">Three.</font>

451
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,742
<font color="#ffff80">Two. One.</font>

452
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:54,344
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.</font>

453
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:55,905
<font color="#ffff80">So you keep saying.</font>

454
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:57,263
<font color="#ffff80">Follow me.</font>

455
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,393
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Confundus.</i></font>

456
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,232
<font color="#ffff80">Come on. That'll wear off in a few minutes.</font>

457
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,268
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Appare vestigium.</i></font>

459
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,333
<font color="#ffff80">Get looking. Oi! Get looking.</font>

460
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:41,727
<font color="#ffff80">That's a Kappa.</font>

461
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,415
<font color="#ffff80">That's a Japanese water demon.</font>

462
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,895
<font color="#ffff80">Tina?</font>

463
00:44:50,773 --> 00:44:51,773
<font color="#ffff80">Tina?!</font>

464
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,765
<font color="#ffff80">What have you found?</font>

465
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,043
<font color="#ffff80">And we're licking the dirt now.
Revelio.</font>

466
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:25,828
<font color="#ffff80">Newt... what made those?</font>

467
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:27,842
<font color="#ffff80">That is a Zouwu.</font>

468
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:34,735
<font color="#ffff80">It's a Chinese creature. They are
incredibly fast and incredibly powerful.</font>

469
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:37,062
<font color="#ffff80">They can travel a thousand miles in a
day</font>

470
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:41,094
<font color="#ffff80">and this one could take you from one part
of Paris to the next in a single leap.</font>

471
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:46,352
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, good boy.</font>

472
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,102
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob, she was here.
Tina stood here.</font>

473
00:45:51,504 --> 00:45:53,835
<font color="#ffff80">She has incredibly narrow
feet, have you noticed?</font>

474
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:57,150
<font color="#ffff80">Can't say that I have.</font>

475
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,128
<font color="#ffff80">Then someone came towards her.</font>

476
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:16,852
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Avenseguim.</i></font>

477
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,851
<font color="#ffff80">- Follow that feather.
- What?</font>

478
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,812
<font color="#ffff80">- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.</font>

479
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,518
<font color="#ffff80">Where is he? Ah, Accio Niffler.</font>

480
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:36,918
<font color="#ffff80">Let go of the bucket!</font>

481
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,176
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Bienvenue Au Ministère
des Affaires Magiques.</i></font>

482
00:47:17,354 --> 00:47:20,309
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, I don't know
what you just said at all.</font>

483
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:25,174
<font color="#ffff80">Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.
What is your business, please?</font>

484
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:29,877
<font color="#ffff80">I need to speak to Tina Goldstein.</font>

485
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:35,502
<font color="#ffff80">She's an American Auror working
on a case here.</font>

486
00:47:39,759 --> 00:47:42,197
<font color="#ffff80">We have no Tina Goldstein here.</font>

487
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:45,373
<font color="#ffff80">No, it's... I'm sorry there
must be some sort of mistake.</font>

488
00:47:45,374 --> 00:47:48,273
<font color="#ffff80">See, I know she's in Paris,
she sent me a postcard.</font>

489
00:47:48,274 --> 00:47:50,754
<font color="#ffff80">I brought it, I can show it to you.
Maybe you</font>

490
00:47:50,779 --> 00:47:53,258
<font color="#ffff80">can help me find her here?
It's just in here.</font>

491
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:54,531
<font color="#ffff80">Oh rabbits!</font>

492
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:57,017
<font color="#ffff80">If you can just wait one moment!</font>

493
00:47:57,018 --> 00:48:00,154
<font color="#ffff80">I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it. Where?</font>

494
00:48:00,768 --> 00:48:02,178
<font color="#ffff80">One second.</font>

495
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:07,296
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Please.</i></font>

496
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,615
<font color="#ffff80">Could we at least stop
for a coffee, or like a...</font>

497
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,693
<font color="#ffff80">Not now, Jacob.</font>

498
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:49,970
<font color="#ffff80">This way. Come on.</font>

499
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:54,017
<font color="#ffff80">Pain Au chocolat? Half a
croissant, or like, a bonbon?</font>

500
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:55,018
<font color="#ffff80">This way.</font>

501
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:01,267
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob!</font>

502

<font color="#ffff80">Madame?</font>

504

505
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,078

00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:47,044
<font color="#ffff80">C'est votre fils, madame.</font>

508
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:48,316
<font color="#ffff80">Qui êtes-vous?</font>

509
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:49,927
<font color="#ffff80">Are you Irma?</font>

510
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:53,464
<font color="#ffff80">Are you ...? Are you Irma Dugard?</font>

511
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:59,544
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry. Your name is
on my adoption paper.</font>

512

513
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:07,651
<font color="#ffff80">You gave me to Mrs. Barebone in New York.</font>

516
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:36,371

517
00:52:39,147 --> 00:52:41,373

520
00:53:01,016 --> 00:53:03,883
<font color="#ffff80">But why is your name on my adoption
paper?</font>

521
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,589
<font color="#ffff80">I took you to Mrs. Barebone</font>

522
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:11,322
<font color="#ffff80">because she was supposed to look after
you.</font>

- Listen to me...</font>

538
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:15,019
<font color="#ffff80">Like the mind reading.</font>

539
00:56:21,132 --> 00:56:23,710
<font color="#ffff80">I was lucky to have someone like her</font>

540
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:26,002
<font color="#ffff80">even interested in anything
I thought.</font>

541
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,018
<font color="#ffff80">You know what I mean?</font>

542
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:31,779
<font color="#ffff80">Sorry?</font>

543
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,460
<font color="#ffff80">I was saying, you're sure the guy
is here that we're looking for?</font>

544
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,633
<font color="#ffff80">Definitely. The feather says so.</font>

545
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:15,540
<font color="#ffff80">- Is that the guy we're looking for?
- Yes.</font>

546
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:22,391
<font color="#ffff80">Sire.</font>

547
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,314
<font color="#ffff80">Err... bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.</font>

548
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,684
<font color="#ffff80">Oh wait, no, sorry!</font>

549
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:31,685
<font color="#ffff80">We were just wondering if
you'd come across uh, a friend of ours...</font>

550
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:33,390
<font color="#ffff80">Tina Goldstein.</font>

551

553
00:57:38,097 --> 00:57:42,723
<font color="#ffff80">When Aurors go missing, the
Ministry tend to come looking. So...</font>

554
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:47,614
<font color="#ffff80">No, now I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.</font>

555
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:48,638
<font color="#ffff80">Is she tall? Dark? Rather</font>

556
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,912
<font color="#ffff80">Dark rather...</font>

557
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,404
<font color="#ffff80">- intense?
- Beautiful.</font>

558
00:57:53,612 --> 00:57:56,042
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah, what I meant to say-</font>

559
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:58,357
<font color="#ffff80">she's very-very pretty!</font>

560
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:02,633
<font color="#ffff80">I think I saw someone like this last night.</font>

561
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,120
<font color="#ffff80">- Perhaps if I showed you where?
- If you wouldn't mind. That would be...</font>

562
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:10,427
<font color="#ffff80">- That would be lovely.
- Sure.</font>

563
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:50,252
<font color="#ffff80">Tina?</font>

564
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,185
<font color="#ffff80">- Newt!

565
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:59,918
<font color="#ffff80">My apologies, Mr. Scamander!</font>

566
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:03,918
<font color="#ffff80">I shall return and release you once
Credence is dead!</font>

568
00:59:04,948 --> 00:59:08,626
<font color="#ffff80">You see, either he dies... or I do.</font>

570
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:17,337
<font color="#ffff80">Oh no. No, no, no.</font>

571
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,185
<font color="#ffff80">Well, that's not the best
start to a rescue attempt.</font>

572
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:28,177
<font color="#ffff80">This was a rescue attempt?</font>

573
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:30,778
<font color="#ffff80">You've just lost me my only lead.</font>

574
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:33,667
<font color="#ffff80">Well, how was the interrogation
going before we turned up?</font>

575
00:59:37,268 --> 00:59:38,518
<font color="#ffff80">Newt!</font>

576
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:44,072
<font color="#ffff80">Well done, Pick.</font>

577
00:59:46,742 --> 00:59:50,227
<font color="#ffff80">- So, you need this man, you say?
- Yeah.</font>

578
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:53,810
<font color="#ffff80">I think this man knows where
Credence is, Mr. Scamander.</font>

579
00:59:58,256 --> 01:00:00,261
<font color="#ffff80">Well, that'll be the Zouwu.</font>

580
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,527
<font color="#ffff80">Come on, Newt, get out of there!</font>

581
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:51,736
<font color="#ffff80">What were the three biggest
mistakes that you made last time?</font>

582
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:54,120
<font color="#ffff80">Caught by surprise, sir.</font>

583
01:01:54,518 --> 01:01:55,799
<font color="#ffff80">What else?</font>

584
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:58,245
<font color="#ffff80">Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.</font>

585
01:01:58,246 --> 01:02:00,178
<font color="#ffff80">Very good. And the last one...</font>

586
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,106
<font color="#ffff80">the most important one?</font>

587
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:13,978
<font color="#ffff80">Not learning from the first two.</font>

588
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:17,768
<font color="#ffff80">This is a school, you've no right</font>

589
01:02:18,018 --> 01:02:22,533
<font color="#ffff80">I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and
I have the right to go wherever I please.</font>

590
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:25,417
<font color="#ffff80">Out of here.</font>

591
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,219
<font color="#ffff80">Go with Professor McGonagall, please.</font>

592
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:40,479
<font color="#ffff80">He's the best teacher we've got.</font>

593
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,765

- Get out!</font>

594
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,318
<font color="#ffff80">Come, McClaggan.</font>

595
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,624
<font color="#ffff80">Newt Scamander is in Paris.</font>

596

<font color="#ffff80">Really?</font>

597
01:02:54,044 --> 01:02:56,579
<font color="#ffff80">Cut the pretense. I know
he's there on your orders.</font>

598
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,487
<font color="#ffff80">If you'd ever had the
pleasure to teach him, you'd</font>

599
01:02:59,512 --> 01:03:02,076
<font color="#ffff80">know Newt is not a great
follower of orders.</font>

600

<font color="#ffff80">You've read The Predictions
of Tycho Dodonus??</font>

- Yes, I know it.</font>

604
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:20,024
<font color="#ffff80">There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the Obscurial.</font>

605
01:03:20,682 --> 01:03:22,514
<font color="#ffff80">They say that Grindelwald wants.</font>

606
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:25,124
<font color="#ffff80">A highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.</font>

607
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:30,686
<font color="#ffff80">And yet Scamander appears wherever
the Obscurial goes, to protect him.</font>

608
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:35,908
<font color="#ffff80">Meanwhile you have built up quite a
little network of international contacts.</font>

609
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:39,803
<font color="#ffff80">However long you keep me and my
friends under surveillance...</font>

610
01:03:39,804 --> 01:03:43,102
<font color="#ffff80">You're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers.</font>

611
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,561
<font color="#ffff80">Because we want the same thing:
the defeat of Grindelwald.</font>

612
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:53,829
<font color="#ffff80">But I warn you,
your policies of suppression and violence</font>

613
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,285
<font color="#ffff80">are pushing supporters
into his arms.</font>

614
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:58,403
<font color="#ffff80">I'm not interested in your warnings!</font>

615
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:05,581
<font color="#ffff80">Now, it pains me to say it, because</font>

616
01:04:05,872 --> 01:04:07,083
<font color="#ffff80">Well, I don't like you.</font>

01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:10,352
<font color="#ffff80">But...</font>

wizard who is his equal.</font>

619
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,579
<font color="#ffff80">I need you to fight him.</font>

620
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,511
<font color="#ffff80">I cannot.</font>

621
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,085
<font color="#ffff80">Because of this?</font>

622
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:45,477
<font color="#ffff80">You and Grindelwald were
as close as brothers.</font>

623
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:48,617
<font color="#ffff80">We were closer than brothers.</font>

624
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,810
<font color="#ffff80">Will you fight him?</font>

625
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,393
<font color="#ffff80">I can't.</font>

626
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,018
<font color="#ffff80">Then you have chosen your side.</font>

627
01:05:12,352 --> 01:05:15,597
<font color="#ffff80">From now on, I shall know
every spell you cast..</font>

628
01:05:15,598 --> 01:05:16,780
<font color="#ffff80">I'm doubling the watch on you</font>

629
01:05:16,781 --> 01:05:19,965
<font color="#ffff80">and you will no longer teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts.</font>

01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,170
<font color="#ffff80">I don't want to talk about it!</font>

673
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:52,676
<font color="#ffff80">They know me, or they'd hide.</font>

674
01:09:55,907 --> 01:09:59,657
<font color="#ffff80">They only nest in trees with wand quality
wood,</font>

675
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:01,817
<font color="#ffff80">did you know that?</font>

676
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,446
<font color="#ffff80">And they have very complex social lives.</font>

677
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:11,139
<font color="#ffff80">If you watch them for
long enough, you realize.</font>

678
01:10:28,953 --> 01:10:30,259
<font color="#ffff80">Hello, Leta.</font>

679
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,980
<font color="#ffff80">This is a surprise.</font>

680
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,102
<font color="#ffff80">Finding me in a classroom?</font>

681
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:40,736
<font color="#ffff80">Was I such a bad student?</font>

682
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,998
<font color="#ffff80">On the contrary, you
were one of my cleverest</font>

683
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:44,699
<font color="#ffff80">I said bad, not stupid.</font>

684
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:52,096
<font color="#ffff80">Don't bother answering.</font>

685
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,398
<font color="#ffff80">- I know you never liked me..
- Well, you're wrong.</font>

686
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,076
<font color="#ffff80">I never thought you bad.</font>

687
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:00,828
<font color="#ffff80">You were alone, then. Everybody else did.</font>

688
01:11:01,296 --> 01:11:02,312
<font color="#ffff80">And they were right.</font>

689
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:05,052
<font color="#ffff80">I was wicked.</font>

690
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,111
<font color="#ffff80">Leta, I know how painful the rumors
about your brother Corvus must</font>

691
01:11:10,136 --> 01:11:11,151
<font color="#ffff80">be for you.</font>

692
01:11:11,176 --> 01:11:15,602
<font color="#ffff80">No, you don't. Not unless you
had a brother who died too.</font>

693
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,674
<font color="#ffff80">In my case, it was my sister.</font>

694
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:22,463
<font color="#ffff80">Did you love her?</font>

695
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,499
<font color="#ffff80">Not as well as I
should have done.</font>

696
01:11:37,185 --> 01:11:39,102
<font color="#ffff80">Never too late to free yourself.</font>

697
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:46,491
<font color="#ffff80">Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.</font>

698
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:51,908
<font color="#ffff80">Regret is my constant companion.</font>

699
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:54,824
<font color="#ffff80">Do not let it become yours.</font>

700
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,264
<font color="#ffff80">Oh No, thank you.</font>

701
01:12:07,853 --> 01:12:11,532
<font color="#ffff80">Well, you've been real kind, but...</font>

702
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:16,654
<font color="#ffff80">my sister Tina's
probably worried sick about me...</font>

703
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:19,093
<font color="#ffff80">you know, banging on all the doors
and things...</font>

704
01:12:20,505 --> 01:12:21,916
<font color="#ffff80">so I think I'd better be going.</font>

705
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:24,184
<font color="#ffff80">But you haven't met your host.</font>

706
01:12:24,185 --> 01:12:25,633
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, are you married?</font>

707
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,062
<font color="#ffff80">Let's say... deeply committed.</font>

708
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:36,500
<font color="#ffff80">You see, I can't tell
if you're making a joke</font>

709
01:12:37,965 --> 01:12:39,435
<font color="#ffff80">or if you're just...
French.</font>

710
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:51,784
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, knock it off.</font>

711
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:00,478
<font color="#ffff80">You stay right there.</font>

712
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,281
<font color="#ffff80">I know what you are.</font>

713
01:13:03,523 --> 01:13:04,607
<font color="#ffff80">Quennie.</font>

714
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:08,200
<font color="#ffff80">We are not here to hurt you.</font>

715
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:10,935
<font color="#ffff80">We only want to help you.</font>

716
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:15,185
<font color="#ffff80">You're so very, very far from home.</font>

717
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:20,370
<font color="#ffff80">Far away from everything you
love. Everything that was comfortable.</font>

718
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:26,496
<font color="#ffff80">I would never see you harmed, ever.</font>

719
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,276
<font color="#ffff80">It is not your fault that your
sister is an Auror.</font>

720
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:38,500
<font color="#ffff80">I wish you were working
with me now towards a</font>

721
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:42,837
<font color="#ffff80">world where we wizards
are free to live openly,</font>

722
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:46,098
<font color="#ffff80">and to love freely.</font>

723
01:13:57,719 --> 01:13:59,279
<font color="#ffff80">You are an innocent.</font>

724
01:14:01,627 --> 01:14:03,227
<font color="#ffff80">So go now.</font>

725
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,269
<font color="#ffff80">Leave this place.</font>

726
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:32,359
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, Newt, buddy.</font>

727
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:36,453
<font color="#ffff80">Tina's up here. She's all by her lonesome</font>

728
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:39,007
<font color="#ffff80">and maybe you want to come
up and keep her company?</font>

729
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,577
<font color="#ffff80">I've been looking for food, and
I ain't found any. So, I guess I'm</font>

730
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:48,838
<font color="#ffff80">gonna go upstairs and try my
luck in the-I dunno-the attic!</font>

731
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,185
<font color="#ffff80">You're all right.
<i>Relaxio.</i></font>

732
01:15:58,992 --> 01:15:59,997
<font color="#ffff80">Okay.</font>

733
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,665
<font color="#ffff80">She's responded well to the Dittany.</font>

734
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,956
<font color="#ffff80">She was born to run, you see.</font>

735
01:16:18,462 --> 01:16:21,405
<font color="#ffff80">I think she's just lacking in confidence</font>

736
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,444
<font color="#ffff80">Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in
your case that might help revive this man?</font>

737
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:27,819
<font color="#ffff80">I need to question him.</font>

738
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,496
<font color="#ffff80">I think he knows who
Credence really is.</font>

739
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:31,580
<font color="#ffff80">The scars on his hand suggest
an unbreakable vow...</font>

740
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:35,269
<font color="#ffff80">- an unbreakable vow.
- Unbreakable vow. I noticed that too.</font>

741
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,694
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Lumos.</i></font>

742
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,080
<font color="#ffff80">What was that?</font>

743
01:16:55,085 --> 01:16:57,407
<font color="#ffff80">There must be a water dragon in that sewer</font>

744
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,453
<font color="#ffff80">they carry these
parasites, you see. They...</font>

745
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:03,932
<font color="#ffff80">- Jacob?
- Yeah?</font>

746
01:17:05,617 --> 01:17:08,797
<font color="#ffff80">In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.</font>

747
01:17:08,822 --> 01:17:09,881
<font color="#ffff80">Tweezers?</font>

748
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:12,650
<font color="#ffff80">- They're thin and pointy...
- Thin, little pointy things.</font>

749
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,371
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, I know what tweezers are.</font>

750
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:19,324
<font color="#ffff80">You might not want to watch this...</font>

751
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,833
<font color="#ffff80">I can handle it.</font>

752
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:27,200
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

753
01:17:27,616 --> 01:17:29,512
<font color="#ffff80">Come on.</font>

754
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:31,726
<font color="#ffff80">Oh come on.</font>

755
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:35,617
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob, will you take that for me?</font>

756
01:17:38,852 --> 01:17:40,698
<font color="#ffff80">Calamari..</font>

757
01:17:42,401 --> 01:17:44,590
<font color="#ffff80">I must kill him.</font>

758
01:17:44,957 --> 01:17:45,957
<font color="#ffff80">Who?</font>

759
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,329
<font color="#ffff80">Credence?</font>

760
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:52,965
<font color="#ffff80">It may take him a few hours to recover.
The parasite's poison is quite strong.</font>

761
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:56,933
<font color="#ffff80">I'll have to go back to the
Ministry with what I've got.</font>

762
01:17:58,978 --> 01:18:00,737
<font color="#ffff80">It was nice to see you
again, Mr. Scamander.</font>

763
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:04,018
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, hold on one second, will you?
Well, hold on!</font>

764
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,275
<font color="#ffff80">Wait! Tina!</font>

765
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:12,663
<font color="#ffff80">You didn't mention salamanders, did you?</font>

766
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:15,389
<font color="#ffff80">No, she just ran.
I don't know...</font>

767
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:17,797
<font color="#ffff80">So you chase after her!</font>

768
01:18:18,768 --> 01:18:21,353
<font color="#ffff80">Tina. Please, just listen to me-</font>

769
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,413
<font color="#ffff80">Mr. Scamander, I need to
go talk to the Ministry.</font>

770
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:27,816
<font color="#ffff80">And I know how
you feel about Aurors.</font>

771
01:18:27,817 --> 01:18:30,861
<font color="#ffff80">I may have been a little strong in the way
that I expressed myself in that letters.</font>

772
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:34,021
<font color="#ffff80">What was the exact phrase? “A
bunch of careerist hypocrites”?</font>

773
01:18:34,022 --> 01:18:35,847
<font color="#ffff80">I'm sorry, but I can't admire people</font>

774
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:38,989
<font color="#ffff80">whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is “kill it”!</font>

775
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,383
<font color="#ffff80">I'm an Auror and I don't...</font>

776
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,587
<font color="#ffff80">Yes, and that's because
you've gone middle head!</font>

777
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:44,999
<font color="#ffff80">Excuse me?</font>

778
01:18:45,437 --> 01:18:48,277
<font color="#ffff80">It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the Runespoor.</font>

779
01:18:48,302 --> 01:18:49,611
<font color="#ffff80">The middle one is a visionary.</font>

780
01:18:49,612 --> 01:18:54,238
<font color="#ffff80">Every Auror in Europe wants Credence
dead-except you. You've gone middle head.</font>

781
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:58,451
<font color="#ffff80">Who else uses that
expression, Mr. Scamander?</font>

782
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:00,910
<font color="#ffff80">I think it might just be me.</font>

783
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,069
<font color="#ffff80">It's Grindelwald. He's
calling his followers.</font>

784
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,768
<font color="#ffff80">It's too late.</font>

785
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,967
<font color="#ffff80">Grindelwald's come for Credence.</font>

786
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:56,855
<font color="#ffff80">He might already have him.</font>

787
01:19:56,856 --> 01:20:00,136
<font color="#ffff80">It's not too late.
We can still get to him first.</font>

788
01:20:02,377 --> 01:20:03,961
<font color="#ffff80">Where are you going?</font>

789
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,525
<font color="#ffff80">The French Ministry of Magic.</font>

790
01:20:05,554 --> 01:20:07,760
<font color="#ffff80">That's the last place Credence would go!</font>

791
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,958
<font color="#ffff80">There's a box hidden
at the Ministry Tina.</font>

792
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,615
<font color="#ffff80">It's a box that can tell
us who Credence really is.</font>

793
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,941
<font color="#ffff80">A box? What are you talking about?</font>

794
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:16,642
<font color="#ffff80">Trust me.</font>

795
01:20:19,926 --> 01:20:23,160
<font color="#ffff80">You wanna come out?
Just for a little while?</font>

796
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,131
<font color="#ffff80">Credence.</font>

797
01:20:37,935 --> 01:20:43,088
<font color="#ffff80">- Shh.
- What do you want?</font>

798
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,831
<font color="#ffff80">From you?</font>

799
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:46,645
<font color="#ffff80">Nothing.</font>

800
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:51,343
<font color="#ffff80">For you?</font>

801
01:20:52,626 --> 01:20:54,830
<font color="#ffff80">Everything I never had.</font>

802
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,607
<font color="#ffff80">But what is it you want, my boy?</font>

803
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,963
<font color="#ffff80">I want to know who I am.</font>

804
01:21:10,768 --> 01:21:16,435
<font color="#ffff80">This is where you will find
proof of your true identity.</font>

805

you will discover the truth.</font>

806
01:21:43,102 --> 01:21:45,750
<font color="#ffff80">Father... why did you make me ...?</font>

807
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,709
<font color="#ffff80">Wait!</font>

808
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:51,560
<font color="#ffff80">Wait!</font>

809
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,994
<font color="#ffff80">I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.</font>

810
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:19,822
<font color="#ffff80">Are you a ghost?</font>

811
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:23,662
<font color="#ffff80">No, no, I am alive,</font>

812
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,822
<font color="#ffff80">but I am an alchemist,
and therefore immortal.</font>

813
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:32,310
<font color="#ffff80">You don't look a day
over three-seventy-five.</font>

814
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,000
<font color="#ffff80">Hey, sorry we didn't knock.</font>

815
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:38,636
<font color="#ffff80">No, no matter.</font>

816
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:41,196
<font color="#ffff80">Albus told me some
friends might be dropping in.</font>

817
01:22:42,179 --> 01:22:43,527
<font color="#ffff80">Nicolas Flamel.</font>

820
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,440
<font color="#ffff80">I didn't.</font>

821
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:56,441
<font color="#ffff80">Ah!</font>

822
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:09,771
<font color="#ffff80">At last, we see some developments!</font>

823
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:12,072
<font color="#ffff80">I've seen one of these before.</font>

824
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:14,079
<font color="#ffff80">It was at the fair.</font>

825
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,333
<font color="#ffff80">There was this dame there, and she
had a veil.. I gave her a nickel and</font>

826
01:23:17,334 --> 01:23:19,777
<font color="#ffff80">she told me about my future.</font>

827
01:23:19,778 --> 01:23:23,056
<font color="#ffff80">And she missed out on quite a bit actually.</font>

828
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,283
<font color="#ffff80">Wait a minute! I know him. That's that kid.
That's Credence</font>

829
01:23:34,515 --> 01:23:35,684
<font color="#ffff80">Jesus.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Hey! That's Queenie! There she is</font>

831
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:42,680
<font color="#ffff80">Hi, baby!</font>

832
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,232
<font color="#ffff80">Where is this? Is this-is this here?</font>

833
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,475
<font color="#ffff80">Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.</font>

834
01:23:47,476 --> 01:23:49,976
<font color="#ffff80">It lies in the cemetery of Père
Lachaise</font>

835
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:53,467
<font color="#ffff80">I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.</font>

836
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:55,509
<font color="#ffff80">Thank you, thank you, Mr. Flamel!</font>

837
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,969
<font color="#ffff80">- Ahh!
- Ooh no. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay?</font>

838
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:00,014
<font color="#ffff80">Oh-look after
Mr. Tentacles for me.</font>

839
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:05,146

- Please, you must not go to the cemetery!</font>

840
01:24:22,136 --> 01:24:23,833
<font color="#ffff80">Oh dear</font>

841
01:24:28,054 --> 01:24:31,454
<font color="#ffff80">- What's happening?
- Exactly what he said would happen.</font>

842
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:36,145
<font color="#ffff80">Grindelwald rallies at the cemetery
tonight, and there will be death!</font>

843
01:24:36,146 --> 01:24:37,721
<font color="#ffff80">- Then you gotta go!
- What?</font>

844
01:24:37,722 --> 01:24:40,076
<font color="#ffff80">I haven't seen action
in two hundred years...</font>

845
01:24:40,177 --> 01:24:42,928
<font color="#ffff80">Flamel, you can do this. We believe in you.</font>

846
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,443
<font color="#ffff80">The box is in the ancestral
records room, Tina.</font>

847
01:24:54,468 --> 01:24:55,867
<font color="#ffff80">So, three floors down.</font>

848
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:57,527
<font color="#ffff80">Is that Polyjuice?</font>

849
01:24:57,528 --> 01:24:59,869
<font color="#ffff80">Just enough to get me inside.</font>

850
01:25:07,962 --> 01:25:09,668
<font color="#ffff80">- Who...?
- That's my brother, Theseus.</font>

851
01:25:10,066 --> 01:25:11,201
<font color="#ffff80">He's an Auror.</font>

852
01:25:11,502 --> 01:25:13,202
<font color="#ffff80">And a hugger.</font>

853
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:15,908
<font color="#ffff80">What's happening?</font>

854
01:25:16,049 --> 01:25:19,831
<font color="#ffff80">Grindelwald's rallying. We don't know
where, but we think it's tonight.</font>

855
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:25,767
<font color="#ffff80">- Be careful.
- Of course.</font>

856
01:25:25,768 --> 01:25:28,519
<font color="#ffff80">- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course, I'm going to be careful.</font>

857
01:25:28,982 --> 01:25:31,066
<font color="#ffff80">Listen, I want you to hear this
from me.</font>

858
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:33,422
<font color="#ffff80">They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.</font>

859
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:36,000
<font color="#ffff80">- My brother is dead. He died..
- I know. I know.</font>

860
01:25:36,001 --> 01:25:37,147
<font color="#ffff80">How many times, Theseus?</font>

861
01:25:37,172 --> 01:25:39,582
<font color="#ffff80">And the records, the
records will prove that,</font>

862
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:40,788
<font color="#ffff80">okay?</font>

863

<font color="#ffff80">- They can't lie.
- Theseus.</font>

864
01:25:48,656 --> 01:25:51,872
<font color="#ffff80">I want every person at
that rally arrested...</font>

865
01:25:51,873 --> 01:25:53,673
<font color="#ffff80">- If they resist...
- Sir-forgive me but if we go in too heavy,</font>

866
01:25:53,674 --> 01:25:56,104
<font color="#ffff80">- don't we run the risk of adding to the.
- Just do it.</font>

867
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:15,675
<font color="#ffff80">I don't suppose you can Disapparate on
Ministry premises in France, can you?</font>

868
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:16,776
<font color="#ffff80">No.</font>

869
01:26:18,164 --> 01:26:19,164

mentioned in my letters</font>

the best moment of my life.</font>

961
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,585
<font color="#ffff80">My father was Mustafa Kama.</font>

01:36:01,133 --> 01:36:04,963
<font color="#ffff80">A pure-blood of Sénégalese descent
and most accomplished.</font>

964
01:36:09,153 --> 01:36:12,229
<font color="#ffff80">was equally high-bred-a noted beauty.</font>

965
01:36:13,136 --> 01:36:15,163
<font color="#ffff80">They were deeply in love.</font>

966
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:21,876
<font color="#ffff80">They knew a man of great influence, from a
famous French pure-blood family.</font>

967
01:36:23,014 --> 01:36:25,123
<font color="#ffff80">He desired her.</font>

968
01:36:28,994 --> 01:36:33,562
<font color="#ffff80">Lestrange used the Imperius
Curse to seduce and abduct her.</font>

969
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:37,639
<font color="#ffff80">I tried to prevent it but he attacked me.</font>

970
01:36:39,095 --> 01:36:41,440
<font color="#ffff80">That was the last time I ever saw her.</font>

971
01:36:43,768 --> 01:36:47,334
<font color="#ffff80">She died, giving birth to a
little girl.</font>

01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:49,671
<font color="#ffff80">You.</font>

973
01:36:53,379 --> 01:36:57,097
<font color="#ffff80">The news of her death
drove my father insane.</font>

974
01:36:58,153 --> 01:37:04,343
<font color="#ffff80">With his dying breath, my father
charged me to seek revenge.</font>

975
01:37:06,505 --> 01:37:10,103
<font color="#ffff80">Kill the person Lestrange
loves best in the world.</font>

976
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:12,163
<font color="#ffff80">I thought at
first it would be easy.</font>

977
01:37:12,937 --> 01:37:15,015
<font color="#ffff80">He had only one close relative</font>

978
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:17,060
<font color="#ffff80">You.</font>

979
01:37:17,477 --> 01:37:18,054
<font color="#ffff80">But...</font>

980
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:19,134
<font color="#ffff80">Say it.</font>

981
01:37:20,977 --> 01:37:23,077
<font color="#ffff80">He never loved you.</font>

982
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:31,020
<font color="#ffff80">He remarried not three
months after her death.</font>

983
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:36,173
<font color="#ffff80">He loved her no
more than he had loved you</font>

984
01:37:40,026 --> 01:37:41,272
<font color="#ffff80">But then...</font>

985
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:44,202
<font color="#ffff80">his son, Corvus, was born at last.</font>

986
01:37:44,757 --> 01:37:47,794
<font color="#ffff80">And that man who had never
known...</font>

987
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:49,692
<font color="#ffff80">love was filled with it.</font>

988
01:37:49,893 --> 01:37:53,778
<font color="#ffff80">All he cared about was little Corvus.</font>

989
01:37:57,264 --> 01:37:58,979
<font color="#ffff80">So... this is the truth?</font>

990
01:38:00,351 --> 01:38:02,288
<font color="#ffff80">I am Corvus Lestrange?</font>

991
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:04,288
<font color="#ffff80">- Yes.
- No.</font>

992
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:08,071
<font color="#ffff80">Realizing that Mustafa Kama's
son had sworn revenge,</font>

993
01:38:08,072 --> 01:38:11,214
<font color="#ffff80">your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.</font>

994
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:16,354
<font color="#ffff80">So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for America.</font>

995
01:38:16,355 --> 01:38:19,731
<font color="#ffff80">- He did send Corvus to America, but...
- His servant, Irma Dugard,</font>

996
01:38:19,732 --> 01:38:21,325
<font color="#ffff80">was a half-elf...</font>

997
01:38:21,326 --> 01:38:23,001
<font color="#ffff80">Her magic was weak and</font>

998
01:38:23,002 --> 01:38:25,940
<font color="#ffff80">therefore left no trace I could follow,</font>

999
01:38:27,042 --> 01:38:30,509
<font color="#ffff80">I had only just discovered
how you had escaped</font>

1000
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:33,460
<font color="#ffff80">when I received news I never expected.</font>

1001
01:38:33,461 --> 01:38:36,389
<font color="#ffff80">The ship had gone down at sea.</font>

1002
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:38,350
<font color="#ffff80">But you survived, didn't you?</font>

1003
01:38:39,543 --> 01:38:42,704
<font color="#ffff80">Somehow, someone had
pulled you from the water!</font>

1004
01:38:43,599 --> 01:38:46,354
<font color="#ffff80">A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter.</font>

1005
01:38:46,355 --> 01:38:49,602
<font color="#ffff80">Return, great avenger
with wings from the water.</font>

1006
01:38:49,603 --> 01:38:52,090
<font color="#ffff80">There, stands the despairing daughter.</font>

from the sea, but I</font>

1008
01:38:56,033 --> 01:39:00,008
<font color="#ffff80">I am the avenger of my family's ruin.</font>

1009
01:39:02,613 --> 01:39:03,768
<font color="#ffff80">I pity you, Corvus,</font>

1010
01:39:05,768 --> 01:39:06,893
<font color="#ffff80">but you must die.</font>

1011
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:10,293
<font color="#ffff80">Corvus Lestrange is already dead.
I killed him.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Accio.</font>

1013
01:39:35,796 --> 01:39:39,011
<font color="#ffff80">My father owned a very strange family tree.</font>

1014
01:39:42,497 --> 01:39:44,635
<font color="#ffff80">It only recorded the men...</font>

1015
01:39:48,627 --> 01:39:51,467
<font color="#ffff80">The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.</font>

America, along Corvus..</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren...</font>

1021
01:40:39,477 --> 01:40:41,103
<font color="#ffff80">I never wanted to hurt him.</font>

1022
01:40:46,854 --> 01:40:49,060
<font color="#ffff80">I only wanted to be free of him</font>

1023
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,310
<font color="#ffff80">Just for a moment.</font>

1024
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,310
<font color="#ffff80">Just a single moment.</font>

1025

1027
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:15,200
<font color="#ffff80">So it wasn't your fault.</font>

1028
01:42:18,352 --> 01:42:19,458
<font color="#ffff80">Oh, Newt.</font>

1031
01:42:36,687 --> 01:42:39,527
<font color="#ffff80">Did you know, when
you swapped him?</font>

1032

much.</font>

first.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">What are you talking about?</font>

1046
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:12,343
<font color="#ffff80">It's a trap.</font>

1047
01:44:12,693 --> 01:44:13,745
<font color="#ffff80">Yeah.</font>

1048
01:44:14,938 --> 01:44:18,997
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie-the family
tree-it's all been bait.</font>

1049

out of here, right now</font>

<font color="#ffff80">the great gift of your applause
is not for me...</font>

because of a craving</font>

something new.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">Oh, and what a world we could
make, for all of humanity...</font>

1074
01:46:57,328 --> 01:47:01,157
<font color="#ffff80">We who live for freedom,</font>

1075
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:02,593
<font color="#ffff80">for truth.</font>

1076
01:47:04,569 --> 01:47:06,522
<font color="#ffff80">And for love.</font>

1077
01:47:16,425 --> 01:47:18,303
<font color="#ffff80">It isn't illegal to listen to him!</font>

1078
01:47:19,249 --> 01:47:21,527
<font color="#ffff80">Use minimum of force on the crowd.</font>

1079
01:47:22,857 --> 01:47:24,749
<font color="#ffff80">We mustn't be what he says we are!</font>

1080
01:47:30,733 --> 01:47:35,231
<font color="#ffff80">The moment has come to share
my vision of the future.</font>

1081
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:40,169
<font color="#ffff80">That awaits if we do not rise up</font>

1082
01:47:42,115 --> 01:47:46,652
<font color="#ffff80">and take our rightful place in the world.</font>

1083
01:48:30,943 --> 01:48:32,806
<font color="#ffff80">Not another war.</font>

1084
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:41,979
<font color="#ffff80">That is what we are fighting!</font>

1085
01:48:43,047 --> 01:48:44,699
<font color="#ffff80">That is the enemy.</font>

1086
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,942
<font color="#ffff80">Their arrogance.</font>

1087
01:48:49,098 --> 01:48:50,939
<font color="#ffff80">Their power lust.</font>

1088
01:48:53,151 --> 01:48:54,814
<font color="#ffff80">Their barbarity.</font>

1089
01:48:56,436 --> 01:49:00,627
<font color="#ffff80">How long will it take before they
turn their weapons on us?</font>

1090
01:49:02,626 --> 01:49:05,434
<font color="#ffff80">Do nothing when I speak of this.</font>

1091
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,838
<font color="#ffff80">You must remain calm</font>

1092
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:12,017
<font color="#ffff80">and contain your emotions.</font>

1093
01:49:16,343 --> 01:49:18,572
<font color="#ffff80">There are Aurors here among us.</font>

1094
01:49:28,647 --> 01:49:31,536
<font color="#ffff80">Come closer, brother wizards! Join us.</font>

1095
01:49:32,798 --> 01:49:34,142
<font color="#ffff80">Do nothing.</font>

1096
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:36,809
<font color="#ffff80">No force.</font>

1097
01:49:52,582 --> 01:49:55,614
<font color="#ffff80">They have killed many of my followers.</font>

1098
01:49:56,024 --> 01:49:57,536
<font color="#ffff80">It is true.</font>

1099
01:49:59,102 --> 01:50:03,270
<font color="#ffff80">They confined me
tortured me in New York.</font>

1100
01:50:04,699 --> 01:50:09,682
<font color="#ffff80">They had struck down their fellow
witches and wizards...</font>

1101
01:50:10,478 --> 01:50:15,850
<font color="#ffff80">For the simple crime of seeking the truth.</font>

1102
01:50:16,866 --> 01:50:18,402
<font color="#ffff80">For wanting freedom...</font>

1103
01:50:23,304 --> 01:50:26,948
<font color="#ffff80">Your anger, your desire
for revenge is natural.</font>

1104
01:50:30,563 --> 01:50:33,803
<font color="#ffff80">No!</font>

1105
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,518
<font color="#ffff80">Take this young warrior back to her family.</font>

1106
01:51:14,102 --> 01:51:17,966
<font color="#ffff80">Disapparate. Leave.
Go forth from</font>

1107
01:51:17,991 --> 01:51:21,602
<font color="#ffff80">this place and spread the word.</font>

1108
01:51:22,685 --> 01:51:26,030
<font color="#ffff80">It is not we who are violent.</font>

1109
01:52:14,426 --> 01:52:18,395
<font color="#ffff80">Aurors, join me in this circle.</font>

1110
01:52:19,964 --> 01:52:24,333
<font color="#ffff80">Pledge to me your eternal allegiance.</font>

1111
01:52:24,868 --> 01:52:26,231
<font color="#ffff80">Or die.</font>

1112
01:52:26,529 --> 01:52:29,014
<font color="#ffff80">Only here shall you know freedom.</font>

1113
01:52:29,015 --> 01:52:32,070
<font color="#ffff80">Only here shall you know
yourself.</font>

1114
01:52:39,322 --> 01:52:40,930
<font color="#ffff80">Play by the rules.</font>

1115
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:42,988
<font color="#ffff80">No cheating, children.</font>

1116
01:52:48,536 --> 01:52:50,246
<font color="#ffff80">He knows who I am.</font>

1117
01:52:50,474 --> 01:52:54,201
<font color="#ffff80">He knows what you were
born, not who you are...</font>

1118
01:52:54,202 --> 01:52:56,202
<font color="#ffff80">Credence!</font>

1119
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:12,545
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie. You gotta wake up!</font>

1120
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:17,463
<font color="#ffff80">Jacob, he's the answer.</font>

1121
01:53:17,889 --> 01:53:20,181
<font color="#ffff80">- He wants what we wants.
- No, no, no.</font>

1122
01:53:20,182 --> 01:53:21,182
<font color="#ffff80">Why?</font>

1123
01:53:30,475 --> 01:53:32,807
<font color="#ffff80">This has all been for you, Credence.</font>

1124
01:53:36,354 --> 01:53:37,540
<font color="#ffff80">Walk with me.</font>

1125
01:53:39,643 --> 01:53:41,142
<font color="#ffff80">Honey, no!</font>

1126
01:53:41,143 --> 01:53:42,971
<font color="#ffff80">Walk with me!</font>

1127
01:53:44,915 --> 01:53:46,324
<font color="#ffff80">You're crazy.</font>

1128
01:53:50,304 --> 01:53:51,309
<font color="#ffff80">Not!</font>

1129
01:53:51,310 --> 01:53:54,030
<font color="#ffff80">No! Queenie, don't do it!</font>

1130
01:54:05,227 --> 01:54:06,685
<font color="#ffff80">Queenie!</font>

1131
01:54:23,552 --> 01:54:25,121
<font color="#ffff80">Mr. Scamander.</font>

1132
01:54:25,181 --> 01:54:29,149
<font color="#ffff80">Do you think Dumbledore will mourn for you?</font>

1133
01:54:39,443 --> 01:54:42,079
<font color="#ffff80">Grindelwald! Stop!</font>

1134
01:54:49,566 --> 01:54:50,666
<font color="#ffff80">Leta...</font>

1135
01:55:00,925 --> 01:55:03,005
<font color="#ffff80">This one I believe I know.</font>

1136
01:55:04,169 --> 01:55:05,905
<font color="#ffff80">Leta Lestrange.</font>

1137
01:55:07,185 --> 01:55:09,857
<font color="#ffff80">Despised entirely amongst wizards.</font>

1138
01:55:09,858 --> 01:55:13,145
<font color="#ffff80">Unloved, mistreated...</font>

1139
01:55:14,237 --> 01:55:15,730
<font color="#ffff80">yet brave.</font>

1140
01:55:16,873 --> 01:55:18,783
<font color="#ffff80">So very brave.</font>

1141
01:55:23,475 --> 01:55:25,106
<font color="#ffff80">Time to come home.</font>

1142
01:55:43,257 --> 01:55:44,516
<font color="#ffff80">I love you.</font>

1143
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:54,601
<font color="#ffff80">Go!</font>

1144
01:55:55,927 --> 01:55:56,931
<font color="#ffff80">Go!</font>

1145
01:56:20,579 --> 01:56:22,151
<font color="#ffff80">I hate Paris.</font>

1146
01:57:01,994 --> 01:57:05,495
<font color="#ffff80">Together! In a circle,
your wand into the earth.</font>

1147
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:08,179
<font color="#ffff80">Or all Paris will be lost!</font>

1148
01:57:15,268 --> 01:57:16,368
<font color="#ffff80"><i>Finite!</i></font>

1149

1152
01:59:33,185 --> 01:59:34,745
<font color="#ffff80">I've chosen my side.</font>

1153
01:59:55,663 --> 02:00:01,543
<font color="#ffff80">Oh come here. I've got you.
I've got you.</font>

1154
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:48,159
<font color="#ffff80">I think it's best if he
speaks to him alone.</font>

1155
02:01:22,227 --> 02:01:25,273
<font color="#ffff80">Is he frightened of me still?</font>

1156
02:01:25,274 --> 02:01:26,546
<font color="#ffff80">You need to be careful ..</font>

1157
02:01:27,904 --> 02:01:30,224
<font color="#ffff80">He's not sure he made the right choice.</font>

1158
02:01:31,464 --> 02:01:34,984
<font color="#ffff80">Be very gentle with him.</font>

1159
02:01:40,185 --> 02:01:42,685
<font color="#ffff80">I have a gift for you, my boy.</font>

1160
02:01:54,592 --> 02:01:58,412
<font color="#ffff80">Is it true about Leta?</font>

1161
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,557
<font color="#ffff80">Yes.</font>

1162
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,143
<font color="#ffff80">I'm so sorry.</font>

1163
02:02:11,893 --> 02:02:13,965
<font color="#ffff80">It's a blood pact, isn't it?</font>

1164
02:02:16,676 --> 02:02:18,987
<font color="#ffff80">You swore not to fight each other.</font>

1165
02:02:26,667 --> 02:02:28,960
<font color="#ffff80">How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get?</font>

1166
02:02:33,418 --> 02:02:37,641
<font color="#ffff80">Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the
nature of things he considers simple...</font>

1167
02:02:53,817 --> 02:02:55,046
<font color="#ffff80">Can you destroy it?</font>

1168
02:02:55,247 --> 02:02:56,309
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe.</font>

1169
02:02:58,583 --> 02:02:59,612
<font color="#ffff80">Maybe.</font>

1170
02:03:05,805 --> 02:03:07,573
<font color="#ffff80">Would he like a cup of tea?</font>

1171
02:03:08,933 --> 02:03:10,551
<font color="#ffff80">He'll have some milk.</font>

02:03:12,841 --> 02:03:14,805
<font color="#ffff80">Hide the teaspoons.</font>

1173
02:03:20,545 --> 02:03:25,458
<font color="#ffff80">You have suffered the most
heinous of betrayals,</font>

flesh and blood.</font>

<font color="#ffff80">your brother seeks to
destroy you.</font>

1178
